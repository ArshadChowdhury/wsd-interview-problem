# WSD Interview Problem

## I am asked to review and rewrite some of the code & code's comments to have better readability & functionality of the problem.

### To run the scripts locally, clone this repo and then move to the same directory as these scripts , also make sure you have node & php installed locally.

### To execute the node script of the problem run -

```bash
node waterTapJS.js
```

### To execute the php script of the problem run -

```bash
php waterTapPHP.php
```

You can change the inputs of this function in the Example input values variables down in the code of both scripts.
